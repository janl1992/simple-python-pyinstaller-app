    \begin{abstract}
        In this Research and Development project, the problem of computer-assisted grading step-by-step proofs in the probability domain is discussed.
        Firstly, a definition of mathematical proof in the context of this project is provided. This is followed by a description of the state of the art of computer-assisted grading.
        Then a new proposed approach is evaluated in order to check the equality between two equations from the probability domain. In this approach probabilities of random variables are mapped on to discrete probabilities.
        The \ac{CAS} Sympy validates whether or not these two equations are equal. In this way, several classes of step-by-step proofs can be automatically graded.
        Based on one class of proof the concept of mapping random variables to discrete probabilities is defined. This concept is then extended to other classes of proofs
        (e.g. the union of random variables or the contingency table). For these classes, new mapping algorithms are designed in order to map the random variables on to
        discrete probabilities. The supervisor is so provided with a variety of assignments that can be automatically graded. Finally,
        the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach are discussed and evaluated.
