\begin{lstlisting}[captionpos=b, caption={[Isabelle example] Here the following lemma add\char`_02 is validated: Adding zero to a natural number is equal to this number.
    This is carried out by defining a recursive function in Line 6 - 8. The lemma "add\char`_02" which refers to this function is defined in line 10. The command "apply" instigates Isabelle to start a proof by induction on m. This can be seen in Line 11. In the next line, the command "apply(induction m)" instructs Isabelle to proove all subgoals automatically. }, label={isabelleexample}]
